            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>
                Most of us have experienced or heard of at least one “roommate from hell” story. As the cost of rent continues to explode in a city like Seattle, it can be difficult to find an affordable deal on an apartment. For many college students, shared housing has become one of the only feasible options to find affordable accommodations. Finding the right roommate and getting along with them doesn't necessarily mean that living with them will be a breeze. Everyone has their own lifestyle and these contrasting lifestyles won’t always see eye to eye. Some individuals prefer to wash their dishes right after they cook, while others prefer to let them pile up. Not to mention, some tend to be forgetful and neglect to pay their shared expenses on time. Although living with roommates could be an excellent option to share expenses, it often involves coordination and organization difficulties, leading to misunderstandings and conflict.

            <h2 class="problems">Problems with Existing Apps</h2>
                <h3 class="questions">Questions of Interest</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How can roommates effectively manage and divide household chores to minimize conflicts and ensure a clean living space?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How can shared expenses among roommates be managed in a way that ensures everyone is aware of their financial responsibilities and due dates?
                    </li>   
                </ul>
                <h3 class="apps">Existing Apps</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.cozi.com/">Cozi</a>: provides a shared calendar
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.splitwise.com/">SplitWise</a>: facilitates shared expense coordination
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                These apps fail to address the full range of challenges faced in shared living situations. They mainly focus on only one aspect, such as task management or expense tracking, leaving roommates to juggle multiple platforms for different needs. Furthermore, these apps lack features specifically tailored to the unique dynamics of roommate relationships, such as shared calendars, task assignment functionalities, and financial management.

            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <p>
                To overcome these limitations, a dedicated roommate management app such as <strong>RentMate</strong> is necessary. The primary users of the application will be individuals seeking shared accommodations with roommates, such as college students or young professionals in large cities like Seattle.
                </p>
                <p>
                With RentMate, users will have access to a range of interactive features such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Shared Calender</strong>: to schedule and coordinate task, appointment reminders, and events
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong> Daily Tasks</strong>: to provide a way for roommates to view, assign, and track their daily household responsibilities 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <strong>Shared Expense Tracker</strong>: to monitor and manage shared expenses
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <section2>
                    <h4 class="interaction">User Interaction</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        On the homepage, users are greeted with a shared calendar that displays upcoming due dates and reminders. Adjacent to the calendar, a navigation bar is situated on the left-hand side, featuring buttons for the shared calendar, daily tasks page, and shared expense tracker page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Within the shared calendar, users can effortlessly view and add events by inputting essential information such as the date, time, and name of the event.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On the daily tasks page, users are presented with a comprehensive list of tasks for each day, which they can easily mark as completed when finished. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On the shared expense tracker page, users can access a detailed list of monthly shared expenses and conveniently enter the amounts they have paid.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                </section2>
                <p>
                These features will assist in organizing and coordinating daily/monthly/yearly tasks and expenses to ensure everyone is on the same page. The app’s data will primarily be collected from user input. 
            </p> 
            <h4 class="solution">How does this app address the mentioned problem?</h3>
            <p>
                Utilizing <strong>RentMate</strong> will allow roommates to experience a significant improvement in their living arrangements, by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly solution to the challenges often faced by roommates.
